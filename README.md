Token Pulse is a modern, interactive crypto token dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.
It displays real-time token prices, market movement, and provides a clean, extensible UI for future trading or analytics features.
I have implemented the features like sorting, hover feature among others.
